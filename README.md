K'abot - Low Cost, Arduino-based and Open-Source Robotic Arm for Education

Designed by Craft3D, with the support of Factor3D.

This Repository contains all open source files for building a K'abot, a robotic arm that anyone can make! We encourage the community to develop all kinds of functions you may think of. K'abot has the mision of making robotics accesible for everyone around the world!

Printed parts are designed for not needing support material, easy to print, printable on an area of 105mmx105mm and on less than 7 Hours with layer height of 0.2 mm.

Electronic parts were selected based on low cost and accesibility factors.

Designs for head accesories, more end-effectors and a rover add-on for movilization are being discussed.

We would love to receive your feedback; Contact Us: info@craft3dhn.com

From Honduras, to the world!
